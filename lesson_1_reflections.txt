How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was easy to spot differences between different versions of the same line when they were side-by-side.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will make it easier for me to spot accidental bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The main advantage is that your commits will be made at points that you find make the most sense.
The main downside is that you may not remember to make commits after making sufficiently significant changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs saves one file at a time since it is sufficient for its use case and because a single document can contain as many pages as required.
Git saves multiple files per commit because code for a feature can sometimes span multiple files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It can enhance your ability to spot accidental changes to code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I plan to use it for more fine-grained version control than what I have done previously.
I used to use git only to share code with others. Now I will use it to track smaller changes in my code.
